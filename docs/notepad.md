## üö® **CRITICAL INVESTIGATION: July 28th Gemini Model Switch Impact**

### **Timeline** üîÑ **UPDATED**
- **July 28th, 2025**: **FUTURE** - Planned switch from Claude to Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Current Status**: Still using Claude (January 2025)
- **Analysis Approach**: Study current patterns to prepare for future switch impact detection

### **üìã INVESTIGATION PLAN**

#### **Phase 1: Current Pattern Analysis** ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS  
**Goal**: Understand current scheduled action patterns to prepare for future switch monitoring

**Key Questions**:
1. What does a "complete" scheduled action look like in current memory data?
2. How do we identify incomplete vs complete scheduled actions?
3. What are normal completion patterns with Claude?
4. How can we detect when Gemini stops mid-chain in the future?

**Data Sources**:
- `memories` table (content analysis for completion patterns)
- `scheduled_actions` table (if exists)
- User activity patterns pre/post switch

**Analysis Points**:
- Search for "Would you like me to continue?" or similar phrases
- Tool call completion rates
- Memory chain length and structure
- Email tool usage patterns

#### **Phase 2: Specific User Impact Analysis** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Focus Users**:
- sam.palm@wmg.com (WMG - 75% decline)
- stephanie.guerrero@onerpm.com (OneRPM - 30% decline)
- All PMF users who churned post-July 28th

#### **Phase 3: Solution Implementation** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
- Build monitoring system
- Fix Gemini prompt patterns
- User outreach strategy

### **üîç FINDINGS & INSIGHTS**

#### **Scheduled Action Analysis**
*Based on recent 14-day analysis (Current Claude usage)*

**‚úÖ Complete Action Pattern** (40 found):
- All scheduled actions currently complete successfully
- All have `hasEmailSent: true`
- Pattern: Assistant reasoning ‚Üí Tool calls ‚Üí Email delivery
- Dates: 2025-07-18 onwards

**‚ö†Ô∏è Concerning Findings**:
- **111 continuation prompts found** - Even with Claude!
- **111 suspicious memories** - Same instances as continuation prompts
- **0 incomplete actions** - But continuation prompts suggest potential issues

**üìä Current Baseline (Claude)**:
- Scheduled actions: 40 total, 100% completion rate
- Continuation interruptions: 111 instances
- Email delivery: 100% success rate when actions complete

**üîç Detection Framework**:

*Continuation Patterns Detected:*
- "would you like me to continue"
- "do you want me to continue"
- "shall i continue" 
- "continue with"
- "would you like me to proceed"
- "should i proceed"
- "would you like to continue"

*Scheduled Action Indicators:*
- "scheduled", "report", "daily", "weekly", "monthly", "automation", "job", "task"

*Email Completion Indicators:*
- "sending email", "email sent", "sendgrid", "mailto", "email to"

**üí° Key Insight**: Claude shows continuation prompts (111) but still completes actions. The question: Will Gemini's continuation prompts lead to incomplete actions?

#### **Phase 1 Conclusions** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**‚úÖ Baseline Established:**
- We now have a working detection system
- Current Claude performance: 100% scheduled action completion despite 111 continuation prompts
- Framework ready for July 28, 2025 monitoring

**üö® Ready for July 28th Switch:**
- Detection API: `/api/model-switch-impact-analysis`
- Baseline metrics documented
- Monitoring framework established
- Can immediately detect completion rate changes post-Gemini

**‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps (For July 28, 2025):**
1. Run analysis immediately after switch
2. Compare completion rates: Claude (100%) vs Gemini (TBD)
3. Identify users with incomplete scheduled actions  
4. Implement prompt fixes if Gemini completion rate drops

### **üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL NOTES**

#### **API Endpoints Created**:
- `/api/model-switch-impact-analysis` - In development

#### **Investigation Queries**:
*(Document key SQL queries and API calls used)*

### **üìä DATA SNAPSHOTS**

#### **Pre-Switch (July 18-28)**:
- PMF Users: 20
- Daily scheduled actions: TBD

#### **Post-Switch (July 28-Aug 1)**:
- PMF Users: 13 (-35%)
- Daily scheduled actions: TBD
