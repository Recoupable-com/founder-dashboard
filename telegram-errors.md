convo so far

How can I bring my node back online?

on May 7 I started pruning my node

nearly 10 days later, my node is still not back online. 😢 

What command can I run to bring my node back online? (I'm fine with fully resetting again if required)

If you can’t use ssh, that sounds more like a network issue than a specific client issue. I’d assume ping doesn’t work either in that case.

Ok, first step is to update that to 1.15.6 
You missed the Pectra hardfork

What value should I change block gas limit setting to? 
currently '30000000'

or, should I use N to ignore?
